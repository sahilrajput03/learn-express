This folder was generated by `npm init playwright@latest` command automatically.

**Also:**

- I moved the file `example.spec.ts` file form e2e folder to this folder thus I do not see these unnecessary tests in vscode playwright extension in sidebar.
- I don't need these tests so moving the tests to this directory helps that.
