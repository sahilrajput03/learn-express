## Are the logs appended in chronological manner in log files? (ChatGPT)

Is chronological order better than the reverse-chronology order to debug the logs later? Be concise 

Yes, logs are appended in chronological order, meaning earlier entries appear first. Chronological order is generally better for debugging since it preserves the sequence of events, making it easier to trace the flow and identify when issues occur.
