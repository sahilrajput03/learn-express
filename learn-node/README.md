# When was node multi threading introduced? (ChatGPT)

Node.js introduced experimental multi-threading support with worker threads in version 10.5.0 (released in 2018). **Later, it became stable in Node.js 12 (released in 2019).**

Before this, Node.js was primarily single-threaded due to its event-driven, non-blocking architecture. However, worker threads allow running JavaScript code in multiple threads, making it possible to handle CPU-intensive tasks more efficiently.
